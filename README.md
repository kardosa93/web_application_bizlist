makeAdifference Business Listing

The general idea was to create a web application that could function as a classified business listing where people can advertise their businesses. On user side there is a database driven paginated view of the listing with links to a details page for each business and a prominent area of the home page displaying premium items. There is also a facility to submit new businisses and accept pseudo payment details. The authentication system made up of a login which controls access to admin views (pending pre-authorized business listing submissions and a facility to authorize which results in the business joining the directory listing on the user side).

Technologies used: PHP; MySQL with phpMyAdmin and CSS3
